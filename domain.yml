        You enter a grand room lit by flickering torches. A lavish banquet table sits in the center.
        Paintings hang on the east, north, and west walls. There's a bookshelf beside the door you entered,
        and another locked door on the far end of the room, secured with a number padlock.

        The banquet table is ornate, set with silverware and crystal goblets.
        Roasted pheasants and golden apples sit untouched.
        The tablecloth is embroidered with scenes of ancient battles, but nothing unusual stands out.

        There are three books: "Cooking for Nobles", "Legends of the Realm", and "Royal Bloodlines".
